I use it to draft, organize, and refine all my posts before publishing. Its markdown-based workflow is perfect for my use case such as this website.\nHugo\nHugo is the static site generator powering this blog. It allows me to convert markdown files into a fast and beautifully designed website with ease.\nGitHub\nGitHub serves as my version control and deployment tool. I push my Hugo-generated website to a GitHub repository, which keeps my code and content organized and backed up.\nPrivate Server on Oracle Cloud\nI host my website on a free private server provisioned through Oracle Cloud. I like hosting my own websites. I am also hosting this website on Github pages.\nWith this setup, I can write in Obsidian, use Hugo to generate the site, manage my source code with GitHub, and host it securely on my Oracle Cloud server. This pipeline ensures a smooth and efficient workflow for maintaining this blog.\nSetting up Hugo 1. Installation On Windows: Download the Hugo executable from the official website. Add the Hugo binary to your system\u0026rsquo;s PATH variable, so you can run it from the command line. Verify the installation by running hugo version in your terminal. On Mac: Use Homebrew to install Hugo by running the following command: brew install hugo On Linux: Install using your package manager: sudo apt-get install hugo Verify installation by running hugo version 2. Creating a Hugo Website After Hugo is installed, create a new website using the command:\nhugo new site website_name This creates a new Hugo site in the website_name folder.\n3. Downloading Hugo Themes Browse official Hugo themes site for customizing the look of the website. To install a theme:\nNavigate to the website folder: cd website_name Download your desired theme into the themes directory. In my case, I used: git init git submodule add https://github.com/LordMathis/hugo-theme-nightfall themes/nightfall 4. Setting up hugo.toml hugo.toml is the configuration file for your hugo website. It is where you need to set the global parameters such as title, language, theme etc. You can find more about this in the theme\u0026rsquo;s documentation.\n5. Creating the blog folder inside content Hugo uses a folder structure to organize the website content. You need to create a folder to hold the markdown file that you need to convert into a website page.\ncd content mkdir blog 6. Copy markdown files from Obsidian folder to content/blog You will need to copy the markdown files from the Obsidian folder to the content/blog folder so Hugo can convert it into webpages.\nRun the commands replacing the directories with the source directory and destination directory respectively:\nOn Windows : robocopy \\path\\to\\obsidian\\folder \\path\\to\\content\\blog /E On Linux : rsync -av --progress /path/to/obsidian/ /path/to/website_name/content/blog/ Note: You can find the directory of the obsidian folder by right clicking on the folder inside Obsidian and clicking \u0026ldquo;Show in folder\u0026rdquo;.\n7. Building the website Once you have your markdown content ready and copied over to the content/blog folder:\nBuild website using:\nhugo Start the development server in your browser using:\nhugo server Your website will be available at http://localhost:1313/.\n8. Publishing the website You can use Github pages or deploy to your own server or even a hosting provider.\nUsing Github Pages:\nPush Hugo generated static files (found in public/) directory to your Github repo. Set up Github pages to serve content from the public directory. For a private server:\nTransfer the public folder contents to your server. Serve the files using a web server like Nginx or Apache. Note: For a more efficient workflow, automate rsync/robocopy, hugo, hugo server using a powershell/bash script.\n","permalink":"https://athuull.github.io/posts/my-blog-pipeline/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s how I manage and run this blog:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://obsidian.md\"\u003eObsidian\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nObsidian is my go-to note-taking and writing tool.
