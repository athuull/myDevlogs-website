Hi! I’m **Athul V Anil**, a software developer who enjoys creating efficient and intuitive solutions. I’m particularly passionate about using tools like **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **AWS** to build practical applications and explore innovative approaches, like integrating **AI** into development workflows.

I love collaborating with others to solve challenging problems and continuously learning about new technologies. Outside of work, I enjoy participating in hackathons, gaming, and playing the guitar. These hobbies fuel my creativity and keep me inspired!

Feel free to connect—I’m always up for a good tech chat or collaboration!
